According to Wikipedia, a push-up (USA English), or a press-up (UK English), 
is "a common strength training exercise performed in a prone position:

lying horizontal and face down, raising and lowering the body using the arms."

Push ups are a basic exercise used in civilian athletic training or physical education and,
especially, in military physical training and will develop the pectoral muscles and triceps,
with ancillary benefits to the deltoids, serratus anterior,
coracobrachialis and the midsection as a whole.
