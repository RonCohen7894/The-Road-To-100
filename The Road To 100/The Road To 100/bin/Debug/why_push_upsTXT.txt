Push ups are one of the basic and most common exercises for the human body.
Push ups are not only great for your chest,
but do a tremendous job of defining your abs, triceps, shoulders and torso.

Push ups can be performed no matter where you are, and best of all, 
they are completely free - no expensive equipment or annual gym fees required! 
If you're looking to develop a great chest and shoulders, 
you could do much worse than follow along with the hundred push ups plan. 
Your core strength will also go through the roof too!

To improve your strength, fitness and general health all you need to do is
commit about 30 minutes of your time per week, and follow the push ups training program 
as closely as you can. I promise you will feel much better about yourself and much more 
confident after just a few short workouts.
