If you're serious about increasing your strength,
follow this six week training program and you'll soon be on your way to completing 100 consecutive push ups!


No doubt some of you can already do 50 consecutive push ups,
but let's face it, you're in a big minority. 
Most of you reading this won't even be able to manage 20 pushups. Actually, 
I'm sure many of you can't even do 10.



However, it really doesn't matter which group you fall into. 
If you follow the progressive push ups training program, 
I'm positive you'll soon be able to do 100 push ups!
